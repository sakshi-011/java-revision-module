Java uses a wrapper class for all 8 primitive data types. If we try to assign an expression to int var which results in a number higher 
than Integer.MAX_VALUE, it will result in overflow but will compile as compiler won't try to evaluate the expression. 
Whereas if we try to directly assign a higher value it will result in compilation error. A char var occupies 2 Bytes of memory.
The number gets mapped to a single character.
